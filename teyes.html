    I have designed a website that is visually engaging and user-friendly. The website is divided into three main sections: the index page, the products page, and individual product pages. The index page includes a fixed navbar that allows users to easily navigate the website and access links to different main pages such as Home, Products, Register, and Login. The navbar also includes user customization options, allowing users to adjust the font size and color of the website. The website also includes a slideshow section that captures the user's attention and promotes the products offered on the website.

The products page has a similar navigation bar, but it also includes a basket icon that allows users to easily access their shopping cart and view the number of items they have selected. The page also includes an offer banner that is designed to grab the user's attention as soon as they enter the page. The main section of the page is divided into different categories of products, such as men, women, and bowties. Each category includes a flex container that displays product images and links, making it easy for users to view and select products.

Individual product pages include a simple flex container with a product thumbnail, description, and add to basket button. The page also includes a video that is fixed in the bottom right corner of the page and can be closed by the user if they choose. Additionally, the product thumbnail includes an animation that allows the user to enlarge the image for a better view when clicked.

Overall, my design is aimed at providing an enjoyable and easy-to-use experience for the user, with a clear navigation structure and visually appealing elements.
